    <h1>About Us</h1>
    <p>
        Dragon's Lair is a dummy social networking site created by Alafin Oluwatobi. It was asssigned as an introductory project, and as such, most of it is/was written while Tobi was still a novice at Laravel. Nevertheless, he decided to extend the project, and as such suggestions for new features and bug reports are not only welcome but also encouraged.
